          <h2 class="spacing">Problem Solving Technique</h2>
          <p>
            As I navigate to my fortnight sprint (a series of program and
            non-programming activity for my web development class), I came
            across this topic they call problem solving, we are talking here the
            technical stuff but in essence we can also do this approach in our
            daily task. I my case I need to implement a system to make my
            limited time a more productive one. I would normally do this method
            on my everyday work but I was able to use this technic and
            recalibrate it to suit my programming approach. As I was doing my
            sprint’s activity, I notice that one particular exercise has some
            directive that are confusing and for a propective of somebody doing
            it online make find the instruction lacking.
            <br />
            <br />
            So, I carefully implement the following steps to assist me in
            resolving the above issue.
          </p>
          <ul class="sq">
            <li>Understanding the question</li>
            <li>Device a plan</li>
            <li>Carry the plan</li>
            <li>Test the plan</li>
            <li>Implement the plan/solution</li>
          </ul>

          </div> -->
          <h4>Understanding the question</h4>
          <p>
            I try to narrow the instruction and piece by piece analyse the words
            that was used. Then come up with the understanding of what it wants
            me do to.
          </p>
          <!-- <div class="JS_script-box">
            <img src="JS_scripting1.jpg" alt="JS scripting sample" />
          </div>
          <div class="text-box-1">
            <p class="JS_script-text">Javascript in VS Code Editor</p>
          </div> -->
          <h4>Device a plan</h4>
          <p>
            I try to use my understanding, in this situation I break up the
            instruction on what I need to do. The problem needs me to combine
            two arrays and the link the first array which is the student to the
            other array which would represent their grades. For starter an array
            is similar to a box, like an ice tray in which ice is line up in a
            row. So I need to create a command to read the array of the student
            and then match the value to the other array of their grades. Then I
            need to stores this information to another array then it will be use
            to display the combine array.
          </p>

          <h4>Carry the plan</h4>
          <p>
            I then create the set of commands to read the data from the two
            arrays and then combine them in one array.
          </p>

          <h4>Test the plan</h4>
          <p>
            I then test the program in Chrome, yes the Google Chrome browser
            that we normally use to search a topic or use to open a website. I
            use a certain menu by right clicking anywhere on the screen to open
            the inspect menu. From this screen I can use the console, screen
            where I can run my codes to see if my sets of command will give me
            the result that I was aiming for.
          </p>

          <h4>Implement the plan/solution</h4>
          <p>
            Once I can see that the information match with the two arrays then I
            move to my VS Code, where another program reside to check my series
            of codes that I have tested in Chrome browser. When I got some
            error, I go back to my codes and change it until I finally got the
            no error message.
          </p>

          <h2 class="spacing">Final word</h2>
          <p>
            For the duration of this process there was a time that the
            instruction was a bit confusing, I had to ask for the facilitator’s
            advice. There were some anxious moment since I need to wait for
            their free time for me to clarify certain things in the said
            activity. I know they maybe on to something so while waiting I try
            to do what I can since I only have a certain to time to attend this
            class.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the end my learnings would be to follow the steps I use in the
            problem-solving technique, because it doesn’t only help you manage
            your problem in an orderly manner, you will not overlook anything
            when you are on the process of resolving the issue.
