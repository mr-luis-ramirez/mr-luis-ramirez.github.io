          <p>
            Neuroplasticity as refer by some as a fancy medical term to describe
            a person’s brain ability to learn and adapt. It somehow a rewiring
            process that allows our mind to grow and adjust with new and it’s
            increasing demands. It is also the brain’s skill to adapt in
            response to experiences, learning and even brain damage.
            <br />
            <br />
            This adaptation can involve:
          </p>
          <ul class="sq">
            <li>
              <em>Synaptic Plasticity</em> - Strengthening or weakening
              connections between neurons (synapses).
            </li>
            <li><em>Neurogenesis</em> - The creation of new neurons.</li>
            <li>
              <em>Reorganization</em> - The brain rewiring itself to compensate
              for damage or learn new skills.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Factors the influence Neuroplasticity are as follows:</p>
          <ul class="sq">
            <li>
              <em>Learning and Experience</em> - Doing new activities, acquiring
              new skills, and gaining knowledge can stimulate neuroplasticity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Brain Injury</em> - After a stroke or traumatic brain injury,
              the brain can restructure itself to recuperate lost functions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Stress</em> - Chronic stress can negatively influence
              neuroplasticity.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Final word</h4>
          <p>
            As previous belief that the brain only develop on the early stage of
            life is now being corrected as William James presented the first
            theory of neuroplasticity, suggesting that the human brain is
            capable of reorganizing, In the book "Principle of Psychology"
            written over 100 years ago. It was not until the mid to latter half
            of the 20th century, following a wide range of research which showed
            that many aspects of the brain remain changeable even into
            adulthood, that the term Neuroplasticity came to prominence.
            <br />
            <br />
            Latest research shows that brain development and behaviour are
            guided by a basic genetic blueprint, in addition to a range of
            experiences and all that shapes the emerging brain. As we age, the
            rate of change in the brain, or neuroplasticity, declines but does
            not come to a halt. In addition, we now know that new neurons can
            appear in certain parts of the brain up until the day we die.
            Neuroplasticity can be manipulated in both the healthy and diseased
            brain. Utilising the brains' ability to create and lay down new
            pathways the physiotherapist can play a big role in rehabilitation
            and improved quality of life. Further study suggest that brain can
            be trained and developed, for brain that has been damage or have
            declined due to old age.
