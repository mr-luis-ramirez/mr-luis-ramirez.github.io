          <p>
            A learning plan is a document used to assist and manage learning
            development over time, relevant to individuals, teams,
            organizations, or communities. It summaries goals, events, and
            resources to achieve specific learning outcomes.

            Limitations and Strengths for learning -
            <em

            Skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
            in yourself while at Dev Academy -
