            EQ (Emotional Quotient) vs IQ (Intelligent Quotient)
          </h4>
          <p class="black-text">
            When comparing EQ (Emotional Quotient) to IQ (Intelligent Quotient),
            the fundamental differences between these two types of intelligence,
            would be that IQ primarily measures intellectual abilities such as
            logical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical abilities, EQ
            refers to your aptitude for knowing and handling of emotions,
            commiserating with others, and building effective interpersonal
            relationships.
          </p>
          <h4 class="black-text">Is IQ or EQ an inborn trait?</h4>
          <p class="black-text">
            There will always be a debate about nature versus nurture, but e
            Evidence suggests that both IQ and EQ have a significant genetic
            element. Research have found a strong heritability factor in
            cognitive abilities, implying you can be born with varying degrees
            of intellectual ability. Similarly, study has also unveiled genes
            associated with emotional processing and parameter. This suggests
            some people are more likely to gain emotional intelligence
            personality.
            <br />
            <br />
            On the other hand, environmental factors such as childhood,
            education, and life incidents significantly shape both IQ and EQ
            throughout your life. Therefore, while you might naturally gravitate
            toward either intelligence type, the relationship between genetics
            and environment ultimately determines your cognitive and emotional
            capabilities.

          <h4 class="black-text">Practice Mindfulness</h4>
          <p class="black-text">
            Emphasis on the present moment by paying attention to your breath,
            body feelings, or settings without judgment, and gently redirect
            your thought when your mind wanders. Working mindfulness involves
            breathing methods, directed imagery, and other practices to relax
            the body and mind and help ease stress.
          </p>
