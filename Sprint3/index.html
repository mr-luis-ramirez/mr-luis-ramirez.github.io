            Oh ! my how do I start to tell you about this new friend of mine,
            let me just tell you that he might be a bit intimidating at first
            but as I begin to get to experience it, it is not that complicated.
            I’ am referring to the programming language Javascript that I
            studied on my sprint 3 for my web development training. For me to
            analogize for this language, we must first bring back HTML and CSS
            with their relationship with one another. HTML is like a house, the
            structure which comprise the wall, door, the room and even the
            stairs. To beautify the house you need the paint, the accessories
            like the carpet on the flooring and even some fixture like some
            fancy lights and maybe some paintings on the wall, this is CSS.

          <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
          <p>
            For the Control Flow and Loops, I am going to use baking to describe
            these with a simple metaphor so that you can have a better idea of
            these two computer jargons.
            <br />
            <strong><em>Control flow</em></strong> is like as I mentioned from
            the above statement is like baking, there are steps that you have to
            do for it to come up with a taste and form of a cake, it can be
            sequential so that the ingredients with react with one another and
            some procedure can be done separately so that after the main cake is
            bake, we can add the icing or other glazing for the cake.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong><em>Loop</em> in programming is the repeated
            instruction, like whipping the flour with egg and butter until
            thick, so you keep on mixing until you get the desired result. In
            programming you can have a value that you are aiming so that the
            procedure would stop once you get that value.
            <br />
            <br />
            In programming usually may have a target value or a scenario like
            true, false etc., in order for the process to stop. In baking you
            set a value to aim for a certain quality to terminate the process,
            like maybe the thickness or consistency of the mixture.

          <h2>DOM (Document Object Model)</h2>
          <p>
            A programming interface for HTML, allowing your code to access and
            manipulate the document ‘s structure, style and content. This
            process is like a dog, if you can create your own dog having the
            basic facilities of a normal dog, it would have methods sort of like
            an action and have attribute like characteristic. You access these
            and you can change them to your own. If you like to have it a brown
            coloured skin, then you can say change skin colour to brown. For DOM
            you can access a HTML tag and can change its properties.

          <h2>Array and Objects</h2>
          <p>
            Both Array and Objects are container similar to a box but the
            difference would be for object you can define the properties, like
            if you define a person object. The person object may have name, age,
            height and weight and other information. This will be the basis when
            you fill up the information for this storage, you need to give the
            value to the properties you define when you created this storage.
            <br />
            <br />
            For array, imagine a box with fix case in which it is sequentially
            line up with one another, similar to an egg box only one side (The
            other complex type would be the multi dimension array but that will
            be a bit s stretch to discuss).
          </p>

          <h2>Function</h2>
          <p>
            Both Array and Objects are container similar to a box but the
            difference would be for object you can define the properties, like
