          <p>
            My friend Google said that in web design, margin creates space
            outside an element, separating it from other elements, while padding
            creates space inside an element, between its content and its border,
            and a border is the visible or invisible line around the edge of the
            box.

          <h3>Here's a more detailed breakdown:</h3>
          <p>
            <em>Margin</em> - The space between an element and other elements on
            the page. Think of it as the "outer" space, like the gap between two
            picture frames on a wall. Margins are transparent, meaning you'll
            see the background color or image behind them. Margins can be
            negative, allowing for overlapping elements.
            <br />
            <br />
            <em>Padding</em> - The space between an element's content and its
            border. Think of it as the "inner" space, like the matting around a
            picture in a frame. Padding takes on the element's background color
            or image. Padding cannot be negative.
            <br />
            <br />
            <em>Border</em> - The visible or invisible line around the edge of
            an element. You can control the style (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.),
            width, and color of a border. Think of it as the frame around a
            picture.
            <br />
            <br />
            <em>Content </em> - The core of the box. Itâ€™s around the content the
            other layers are built. Content can have different visualizations:
            it can be text, image, icon or something else.
          </p>

          <h3>Difference between margin and padding in CSS?</h3>
          <p>
            Some people confuse margin with padding, because both terms mean
            spacing and neighbour with border. However, they have principle
            differences and right term operation can save you much time. Margin
            is an external element, which means it exists outside the box. It
            controls the spacing between different elements (boxes) and between
            the element (box) with the edge of the screen. Padding, on the
            contrary, determines inside spacing, which can control how much the
            background color is visible around the content.
