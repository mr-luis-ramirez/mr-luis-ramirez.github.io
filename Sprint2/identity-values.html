          <p>
            Core values are personal ethics or principles that guide you when
            formulating decisions, creating relationships and solving problems.
            Classifying the values that are meaningful to you can assist you to
            develop and reach personal and professional goals.
            <br />
          </p>

          <h4>Ethical Decision</h4>
          <p>
            In my life a have some ethical decision that are not easy to make,
            like when I was an college instructor. I have to give or calculate
            the grade for all student fairly, even it mean that I have to give a
            failing grade for those who unfortunately didnâ€™t pass the standard
            and would be mark as repeater of the course they have enrolled.
          </p>
          <h4>The culture and the people around that influenced me</h4>
          <p>
            The culture and the people around me have influenced my values and
            identity in which I always thinking of others, if my action would
            benefit many people and will result in a positive manner. My parents
            would always remind me to be kind to others and this will be given
            back to you maybe not the same person but other people who you will
            meet in the future as they said you attract the people with the same
            vibration or attitude.
          </p>

          <h4>Support on my learning journey?</h4>
          <p>
            I am betting on my faith on my God that He would assist me in this
            learning journey as I navigate to this ambitious endeavour as I try
            to study and at the same do other important duties that I need to
            attend. Time management will also play a critical key as my study
            will require discipline in scheduling my different task in order to
            multi task all my activities.
          </p>

          <h4>Limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h4>
          <p>
            Time will be my best and worst friend. This will guide me at the
            same time if neglected, I will end up wasting or consuming much more
            than what I need for me to accomplish the task at hand. This
            precious commodity is one resource that I need to learn and be able
            to advance my career and in turn will make my career development
            notch higher to where I am right now.
          </p>

          <h4>Resistance or tension when working with a difficult person</h4>
          <p>
            I use to have a member of the team that would not cooperate because
            he is not comfortable in presenting his piece. What I did is to
            listening to his explanation and I was able to decipher his fear
            more than anything else. The approach I made is to compromise, I
            gave him the least of the task so that he could present this easily
            and would be very short of talking in the audience, since what I
            analyse is that he has a great fear of rejection, this is the prime
            factor for his stage fright.
